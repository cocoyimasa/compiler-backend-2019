# compiler-backend-2019
A compiler backend written by Kotlin.

=======================

Lexer and parser are not implemented now.

So it is only a compiler backend.

Writting any of them is a waste of time, especially a parser.

A parser is very easy to code in mind, but very complex to write by hand.

So use AST-writting-by-hand instead.
